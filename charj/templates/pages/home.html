                <div class="faq-answer">
                  You choose your own pricing! Select any amount starting from $0.50 and pick your billing frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). There are no setup fees or hidden charges. You only pay for the cards you add to the service at the rate you select.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  If an annual charge fails (e.g., due to an expired card or insufficient funds), we'll notify you immediately via email. You can update your payment method through your dashboard. We'll retry the payment automatically, and your card will remain in our system.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  There's no limit! You can add as many credit cards as you want to keep active. Each card gets its own subscription with the amount and frequency you choose.

                <summary>Will these small charges affect my credit score?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  No, small recurring charges will not negatively impact your credit score. In fact, they help by keeping your cards active and maintaining your credit history. The positive impact of preserving account age and available credit far outweighs any minimal effect from the charges.
